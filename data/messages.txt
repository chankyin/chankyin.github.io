This *is* the **first** `message`.
This paragraph is not really worth itself, but we really want to see if it has multiple-line support.
This could have been a simple `Hello world!` message, but the world is *too* tired of greeting every new software, so let's *not* do that.

And this is the second message.
There is no reason to say "Hello world!" the second time you meet the world, especially when you didn't the first time, is there?
Just in case the world feels lonely if every software thinks like this and doesn't say hello to it, hello, world.
